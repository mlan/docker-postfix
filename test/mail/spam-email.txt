The Avangar page describes a process that looks remarkably similar to the Money Laundering jobs described in emails that we catch every day: From the website -


1. Our customer (located in your area) informs us about his wish to buy specified products or services..
2. We supply our client with your contact details and he transfers funds directly to you (cheque sent to postal address specified by you or via bank transfer to your bank account). You inform us the moment the funds arrive.
3. We immediately give an order to ship products to the customer. In most cases this will allow us to ship client's order on the same or next business day.
4. You then transfer the client’s funds to our bank account (or follow other transferring methods as will be stated in your instructions).

The website referred to appears to have been created only a few days before the sending of the emails.
